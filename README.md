# Gym Worm

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

GymWorm can be found at [GymWorm](http://gym-worm.herokuapp.com).

## Description 

This is a gym booking web application built using the MERN stack, Telegram Bot integration and hosted on Heroku. <br />

Gym Worm was created during the Covid-19 pandemic, to allow avid gym-goers to better plan and schedule their gym visits during a time where entries were limited by the hour and gyms had lowered maximum capacities.
